Core Play
=========

This is the Play 2 project accompanying my presentation called "Core Play". It contains all the sample code in the slides, and serves as a starting point for the 'Hands On' session.

Getting started
---------------

This is just an SBT application; you don't need Play 2.

Run `sbt run`, and browse to http://localhost:9000/

For the WebSocket test-screen, browse to http://localhost:9000/
